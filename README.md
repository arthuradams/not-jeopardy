## User Stories
### Bronze
| As a user  | I want to  |
|---|---|
|  Read a trivia question | Try to come up with an answer  |
| Submit an answer to the question  | interact with the game rather than “watch Jeopardy”  |
|  See if my answer is correct | Have a reason to play the game  |
|  See my score |  Have a way to compete with other players |

All of the bronze user stories were imolemented. 

### Silver 
| As a user  | I want to  |
|---|---|
| Have a timed score	 | Get rewarded for quick answers|
|  Have a score based on difficulty |	get a bigger reward for tougher questions |
|   Select difficulty level |	Have a challenge appropriate to my skill and desires |
|   Select increasing difficulty |	Start easy and work my way up   |
|   See questions that include images	| Have a flashier looking game, and answer “who is this person?” type questions   |

Timed scoring was not implemented. I'd like to learn how to do it properly, but I focused on the 'low-hanging fruit' first. 

Difficulty based scoring was implemented, though with values that are prettty arbitrary. Selecting difficulty is not there. 

Image display was implemented, though I realized really doing images properly would require work with scaling them to fit a box, and lots of Photoshop fun to make them look "pretty", 

Why is there a picture of a woodchuck with the Superman question? Because the question was originally, "how much wood could a woodchuck chuck..." and I kept the image because it amused me. 
### Gold
| As a user  | I want to  |
|---|---|
|  Add new questions |	outsmart my friends and crush my enemies! |
| Win actual prizes |	Escape crushing poverty |

None of these were implemented. Add new questions is nice to have, but making them persist is beyond this prohect's scope. 
Actual prizes is listed for the amusement value.
