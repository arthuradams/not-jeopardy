## Planning / Process / Submission
**2: Performing**
>Submission contains clear evidence of planning, adequate documentation, include all from previous category, as well as additional information such as unsolved issues.

Fantastic job here. I am a sucker for a good readme and you made a great one. Gives me a great idea of the work and process that went into making this game. Some other things to consider adding to the readme are set-up/run instructions and a link to your deployed version.

## Technical Requirements
**2: Performing**
>App functions with minimal or no errors and is deployed on github pages

This is a fully functional trivia game. While it could use more questions, you have created an application to which you could easily add some. The next thing I would suggest doing is creating an end-game state so that the user is not stuck on the last "Boom" question.

## Code Quality
**3: Excelling**
>No major code quality issues, makes use of JavaScript best practices appropriately, and follows techniques such as separation of concerns, abstraction, and encapsulation

I can't stress enough how important code readability is in web development, both in this course and beyond. I loved how readable your code was. Keep it up.

I left some comments on how we could make those event listeners towards the end of your code a bit more DRY. Happy to go over this more in person.

## Creativity and Interface
**2: Performing**
>The app displays a personal spin or creative element through its written language, functionality, purpose, and/or CSS. Submission includes proof of HTML / CSS validation

Great theme. I love me some comics trivia. And I learned who 'Mazing Man is!

As I mentioned earlier, the next thing you could do to improve the user interface is to create an end-game state.

When I throw your HTML into a validator I get a few errors. Try that out yourself. They're easy fixes though!
